# Lattice paths

Due to symmetry we can transpose this problem to start from $(0, 0)$ and take steps up or right to $(n, m)$ (generalizing the problem statement which is for square lattices!) for a lattice with $n$ possible right steps and $m$ possible up steps.

Denote the number of paths that lead from $(0,0)$ to $(x, y)$ as $f(x,y)$ for $0 \leq x \leq n$ and $0 \leq y \leq m$. It is thus clear that $f(x,0)=f(0,x)=1$ as the only path leading to the point is $x$ steps to the right or up correspondingly. Further, for $x >0$ and $y>0$ we have that $f(x,y) = f(x-1,y) + f(x, y-1)$ as we can always pass through $(x-1,y)$ and $(x,y-1)$ to get to $(x,y)$ in this case.

Now one may show, for example by induction, that $$f(n,m) = {n+m \choose n}.$$

Base case: 
$f(0,0) = {0+0 \choose 0} = 0$ and for $x>0$ $f(x,0)=f(0,x)= {x+0 \choose x}$ as already mentioned.

Inductive step: As already shown, it is enough to show that
$f(x+1,y) = f(x,y) + f(x+1, y-1)$ which now can be done by using the induction assumption and some simple algebra. Note that it is enough to consider a step in one direction because of symmetry.

Finally then the answer to problem 15 is ${20+20 \choose 20}=137 846 528 820$.
